<p>
    <a href="https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2017/2017-06-05-Minecraft.md" target="_blank">Mojang has requested</a> that I remove the downloads for this version because they contained part of Minecraft's code. I respect their decision and have fixed the issue in <a href="/updates/wurst-6-6" target="_blank">Wurst 6.6</a>. As a result, downloads for any version older than v6.6 are no longer available. Sorry for the inconvenience.
