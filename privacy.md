		<h2 class="text-normal">Google Analytics</h2>
    <p>You know how YouTube videos always have that view counter under them? You might be surprised to hear that, by default, websites don't have anything like that. So if I want to know how many people visit my website, then I have to install a plugin for that. The plugin I use is called Google Analytics. As you may have guessed, it's made by Google.</p>
    <p>Aside from the website, I also want to know how many people are using the Wurst Client itself. And for that I use Google Analytics as well.</p>
    <p>Google Analytics has to collect some anonymized data to make the view counting work. They have their own privacy policy which you can view here: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></p>
    <p>Since Google Analytics doesn't collect any personal data, there is no good reason to turn it off (aside from saving a tiny bit of internet bandwidth, I guess), but you <i>can</i> turn it off if you want to. To turn off Google Analytics on this website, you will need to install the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">GA Opt-Out Browser Plugin</a>. Note that this will turn off Google Analytics on all websites. As far as I know, there is no way to turn it off on just one website.</p>
    <p>Since the Wurst Client can't tell what browser plugins you have installed (and it would be a privacy concern if it could), this plugin won't disable Google Analytics in the Wurst Client. Instead, you can turn it off by going to "Wurst Options" > "Analytics" and setting it to "OFF".</p>

<div class="padding20 no-padding-left no-padding-right">

		<h2 class="text-normal">Sentry</h2>
    <p>The Wurst Client, starting with v7.7, uses <a href="https://sentry.io/welcome/">Sentry.io</a> to automatically report crashes. This makes it easier for me to find and fix bugs, which then makes the Wurst Client better for everyone.</p>
    <p>Sentry has their own privacy policy which you can read here: <a href="https://sentry.io/privacy/" target="_blank">https://sentry.io/privacy/</a></p>
    <p>Sentry also has extremely good security measures and has been certified for all kinds of things: <a href="https://sentry.io/security/" target="_blank">https://sentry.io/security/</a></p>
    <p>I have configured Sentry in such a way that it reports crashes anonymously. After all, I don't really care <i>who</i> got the crash, only <i>how</i> it happened and how I can fix it.</p>
    <p>Due to the unpredictable nature of bugs, it's always possible that some personal information might make it into a crash report. Sentry has a built-in data-scrubbing tool that tries to delete such information automatically, but there is no guarantee that it will catch everything.</p>
    <p>Sentry does not store your IP address and automatically deletes reports after 30 days, even if I haven't fixed the bug by then.</p>
    <p>You can always turn Sentry off in the Wurst Options. (If you don't see the "Sentry: ON/OFF" button in the Wurst Options, that means your Wurst version doesn't have Sentry. It's still fairly new and not all versions have it.)</p>

		<h2 class="text-normal">Google AdSense</h2>
    <p>I use Google AdSense to place ads on this website. They have their own privacy policy which you can view here: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a></p>
    <p>While I don't sell any data to them, they may use data that they already have to "personalize" their ads. You can turn this off by visiting <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank">Google Ads Settings</a> or <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank">www.aboutads.info</a>.</p>
    <p>Note that this won't turn off the ads, it just stops them from being personalized.</p>

		<h2 class="text-normal">CleanMedia</h2>
    <p>I also use CleanMedia to place ads on this website. They have their own privacy policy which you can view here: <a href="http://cleanmedia.net/company/PrivacyPolicy/" target="_blank">http://cleanmedia.net/company/PrivacyPolicy/</a></p>
    <p>You <i>should</i> be able to turn off personalization for these ads using <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank">www.aboutads.info</a> as well, but I'm not entirely sure since their privacy policy doesn't mention it.</p>

    <p>Since I don't have your email address, I can't send you one of those annoying "we have updated our privacy policy" e-mails. Instead, I have a GitHub repository where you can see how this page has changed over time: <a href="https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/WurstClient.net/commits/gh-pages/privacy.md" target="_blank">https://github.com/Wurst-Imperium/WurstClient.net/commits/gh-pages/privacy.md</a></p>
