## Changelog

- Added ["Use swords as tools" checkbox](https://wiki.wurstclient.net/autotool#use_swords) in AutoTool. Disabling this will prevent AutoTool from selecting swords, even if a sword would be the fastest tool to mine the block that you are looking at.

- Improved the speed of [Nuker](https://wiki.wurstclient.net/nuker) and Tunneller.

- Improved the [Nuker](https://wiki.wurstclient.net/nuker) animation.

- Fixed the [Nuker](https://wiki.wurstclient.net/nuker) animation playing twice when using Nuker and Overlay at the same time.

- Fixed ScaffoldWalk.

- Fixed [AutoTool](https://wiki.wurstclient.net/autotool) sometimes selecting the wrong tool.

- Fixed some issues with fake players created by [Freecam](https://wiki.wurstclient.net/freecam) and RemoteView.
