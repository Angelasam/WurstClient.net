## Changelog

- Added AutoFarm hack: Harvests and re-plants crops automatically. Works with wheat, carrots, potatoes, beetroots (MC 1.9+), pumpkins, melons, cacti and sugar canes.

- Improved the description of [PlayerESP](https://wiki.wurstclient.net/playeresp).

- Replaced the [X-Ray](https://wiki.wurstclient.net/x-ray) Blocks Manager with a general-purpose editor for lists of blocks, similar to that in ForgeWurst.

- Simplified the syntax of the `.xray` command.

- Added `.xray reset` command to reset X-Ray's block list.

- [X-Ray](https://wiki.wurstclient.net/x-ray)'s list of blocks can now be edited from the ClickGUI.

- [X-Ray](https://wiki.wurstclient.net/x-ray)'s list of blocks is now saved in "settings.json" instead of "xray.json".

- Fixed [X-Ray](https://wiki.wurstclient.net/x-ray) destroying redstone in singleplayer.
